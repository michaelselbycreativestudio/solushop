                        <p>
                            Solushop attempts to be as accurate as possible. However, Solushop does not warrant that product descriptions or other content of any Solushop Service is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. If a product offered by Solushop itself is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in unused condition.

                        <h2 style="text-align: left;">12. Pricing</h2>
                        <p>
                        "List Price" means the suggested retail price of a product as provided by a manufacturer, supplier, or seller. We regularly check List Prices against prices recently found on Solushop and other retailers. Certain products may have a "Was Price" displayed, which is determined using recent price history of the product on Solushop.
                        With respect to items sold by Solushop, we cannot confirm the price of an item until you order. Despite our best efforts, a small number of the items in our catalog may be mispriced. If the correct price of an item sold by Solushop is higher than our stated price, we will, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before delivering or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation. Other merchants may follow different policies in the event of a mispriced item.                 
                        </p>

                        <h2 style="text-align: left;">16. Disputes</h2>
                        <p>
                        Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any Solushop Service, or to any products or services sold or distributed by Solushop or through Solushop.com.gh will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.<br><br>
                        There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow these Terms and Conditions as a court would.
                        To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent Corporation Service Company, P.O. Box MD 1770, ACCRA - GHANA. The arbitration will be conducted by the Ghanaian Arbitration Association (GAA) under its rules, including the GAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the GAA's rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than GH₵10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, Solushop will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.<br><br>
                        We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
